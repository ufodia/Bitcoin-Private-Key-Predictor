# Bitcoin Private Key Predictor

This project is a machine learning model built using TensorFlow to predict Bitcoin private keys based on public keys. Leveraging a neural network, the model attempts to map public keys to private keys across the 256-bit key space.

> **Disclaimer**: This project is intended solely for educational and research purposes. Predicting private keys associated with real Bitcoin addresses is computationally infeasible due to the immense key space, and this project does not aim to bypass security features of cryptographic systems.

## Overview

This repository provides:
- A **data generation script** for creating training data with random Bitcoin private and public key pairs.
- A **training script** for building a deep learning model to predict private keys from public keys.
- A **prediction script** to infer the private key of a given public key using the trained model.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ufodia/Bitcoin-Private-Key-Predictor.git
   cd Bitcoin-Private-Key-Predictor
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate      # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure TensorFlow is installed. For GPU support, additional steps may be required.

## Usage

### 1. Data Generation

Generate training data by running `data_generator.py`. This will create random pairs of Bitcoin private and public keys within the 256-bit key space. The generated data will be used to train the model to map public keys to private keys.

### 2. Model Training

Train the model using `train.py`. This script loads the data, builds a neural network model, and trains it to predict private keys based on public keys. The trained model is saved as `prediction_model.keras`.

Run the following command to start training:
```bash
python train.py
```

### 3. Prediction

To predict a private key from a public key, specify the target public key in `predict.py`. Then, run:

```bash
python predict.py
```

The predicted private key is saved in `predictions.txt`.

## Project Structure

- `data_generator.py` - Generates random private and public key pairs for training data.
- `train.py` - Loads the data, trains the model, and saves the trained model.
- `predict.py` - Uses the trained model to predict private keys from input public keys.
- `model_utils.py` - Defines the model architecture and helper functions.
- `data_processing.py` - Utility functions for converting and formatting data.

## Configuration

This project allows you to adjust various parameters to customize the model architecture and training data.

### Model Architecture

The model architecture in `train.py` defines the structure and complexity of the neural network. You can fine-tune the following parameters:

- **Layers and Neurons**: 
  - Adjusting the number of layers and neurons in each layer can affect the model's performance. For example:
    ```python
    first_layer_dim = 128  # Number of neurons in the first layer
    hidden_layers = 20     # Total number of hidden layers
    hidden_dim = 512       # Number of neurons in each hidden layer
    ```

- **Activation Functions**:
  - The choice of activation function influences the model’s learning ability. The hidden layers commonly use `relu`, while the output layer may use `tanh` or `sigmoid`. In `train.py`:
    ```python
    from tensorflow.keras import layers
    
    # Model layers
    model.add(layers.Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu'))  # Hidden layer with ReLU activation
    model.add(layers.Dense(output_dim, activation='tanh'))  # Output layer with Tanh activation
    ```

- **Loss Function**:
  - The loss function determines how the model optimizes predictions. `mean_absolute_error` or `mean_squared_error` can be used to balance the model’s sensitivity to errors.
    ```python
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    ```

- **Batch Size and Epochs**:
  - The number of epochs controls how long the model is trained, while batch size affects memory usage and speed. For example:
    ```python
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3000, batch_size=512)
    ```

### Data Parameters

Customizing the training data can enhance model accuracy by exposing it to a larger, more diverse dataset.

- **Number of Key Pairs**:
  - In `train.py`, you can control the number of key pairs generated by setting the `train_data_length`. A larger dataset can improve accuracy:
    ```python
    train_data_length = 10000  # Generate more training samples
    ```

- **Bit Length of Private Keys**:
  - The `bits_secret` parameter in `data_generator.py` defines the bit length of private keys. Although set for the full 256-bit space by default, this can be adjusted for experimentation:
    ```python
    bits_secret = 256  # Default to 256-bit private keys
    ```

---

## Example

After training, specify the target public key in `predict.py`, then use the model to predict the associated private key:

```python
# In predict.py
target_pubkey_hex = "Your target public key in hex format"

# Run the prediction
python predict.py
```

The predicted private key will appear in `predictions.txt`.
